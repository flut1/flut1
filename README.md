# ⚠️ URGENT WARNING

<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flut1/flut1/master/img/nl_zandloper.png" width="200"> Life on Earth is in crisis. Our climate is changing faster than scientists predicted and the stakes are high. Biodiversity loss. Crop failure. Social and ecological collapse. Mass extinction. We are running out of time, and our governments have failed to act. 

### The number of floods worldwide
have increased **15 times** since 1950. In that same period, **wildfires increased sevenfold** and **extreme temperature events increased 20 times** <sup>1</sup>

### Up to 200 species
Are going extinct **every day**. The global rate of species extinction is already at least tens to hundreds of times higher than the average rate over the past 10 million years and is accelerating. **1 million species are threatened with extinction** <sup>2</sup>
